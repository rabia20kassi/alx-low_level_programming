In this file I write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

The C file name has been saved in the variable $CFILE
The output was  saved in the file c, Also I  write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.

The C file name has  been saved in the variable $CFILE
The output file was  named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
